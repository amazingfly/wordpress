== Licenses ==
All items are licensed under the GNU General Public License v2; or, as the case
may be, individually noted below.

As Opus Latere is a Child-Theme of Opus Primus, all related license terms and
copyrights are continued from the Parent-Theme's references.

== Screenshots ==
1. Theme with viewport width set to a 4:3 ratio

== Basic FAQ ==
Please see the `readme.txt` file found under the `../wp-content/opus-primus/`
folder for common questions and answers already addressed in the Parent-Theme.

Q: I'm using an older version of Opus Primus, why won't this Child-Theme work?

Opus Latere requires Opus Primus to be at least version 1.3 or later to work.

== Notes ==
1. $content_width is set based on how many columns being used and the common
display size of 1024px * 768px.

This being the case, the following widths will be used:
- one-column: 990px
- two-column: 700px
- three-column: 450px

2. Default Menu depth levels may be of concern in some cases. As it stands, the
default menus are not restricted to any specific depth except the Search Results
Menu which is restricted to a single level only when a custom menu is not used.

3. Future revisions of the 'theme-version-guidelines.txt' file may not
necessarily be recorded in the changelog. The "Theme Version Guidelines" page
found at http://opusprimus.com/under-the-page/theme-version-guidelines/ will
be considered the most current at all times. The version of the guidelines
included with the theme will simply be a copy of the noted page.

== Changelog ==
